# OpenAI API Key Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Create a .env file at the ROOT of this project (same directory as this .env.example file)
# 2. Copy the content below into your .env file
# 3. Replace 'your-api-key-here' with your actual OpenAI API key
# 4. Verify that .env is in .gitignore (it should already be there)
# 5. NEVER commit your .env file to git - it contains your secret API key!

# i seriously mean NEVER, it is a pain to manipulate past commits. NEVER
